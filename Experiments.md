### (S08) External Buttons
Here, you can find screenshots of using the external buttons. Note that we needed to use the Xbox Adaptive Controller to connect the external buttons, so we provide screen shots of both devices here. The left-side device is the external buttons, and the right one is the Xbox Adaptive Controller:
