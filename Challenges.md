It concerns the accessibility due to lack of their proper positioning.
### i) power switches (CH01)
### ii) keyboards (CH02)
### iii) monitors (CH03) 

## Fine motor control:

## Regular input device:

### i) click function (CH09)
### ii) cursor pointing (CH10)
### iii) hold function (CH11)
### iv) scroll function (CH12).
### v) reaching keys on keyboard (CH13)
### vi) strength to press a key (CH14).

## severely hampered motor abilities:
### i) completely immobile upper limb with speech control (CH15)
### ii) completely immobile upper limb without speech control (CH16)

# Documentation Challenges
