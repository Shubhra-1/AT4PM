There are several challenges encountered by motor impaired students. These challenges are classified into into input and documentation challenges. These are explained below:

# Input Challenges

## Accessible Environment:
It concerns the accessibility due to lack of proper positioning of facilities. Accessible environment can be further divided into:

### i) Power switches (CH01)
### ii) Keyboards (CH02)
### iii) Monitors (CH03) 

## Fine motor control:
It includes challenges requiring minor adjustments in existing input devices for the motor disabled person with reduced function in a finger, an arm, etc. It includes the following:

### i) Accidental key strokes (CH04): 
It causes clicking the wrong key due to lack of control.
### ii) One-sided access (CH05)
It is the lack of function in one of the upper limbs.
### iii) Fine cursor movement (CH06)
It is due to the lack of ability to move the cursor to the intended point, accurately.
### iv) Use of modifier keys (CH07)
It refers to the inability of pressing two keys at once like ctrl+c.
### v) Key pressed longer than intended (CH08)
It refers to lack of speed in clicking some keys to prevent repeated actions, e.g., pressing a dash (-) key longer means that it will produce a dashed-line. 

## Regular input device:
It refers to the challenges in using the regular input device. It can be broadly classified under mouse and keyboard functions.

The mouse inputs can be divided into following:

### i) Click function (CH09)
It refers to the left and right click of the mouse due to the lack of finger movement.
### ii) Cursor pointing (CH10)
It deals with the inability to control and move the mouse for cursor placement.
### iii) Hold function (CH11)
It is the inability to click, hold and move the mouse. It is caused due to lack of functioning of wrist and fingers.
### iv) Scroll function (CH12)
The difficulty in moving the scroll bar is marked by this challenge. It comprises of click, hold and move functionalities.

The keyboard functions that pose a challenge are:

### v) Reaching keys on keyboard (CH13)
It concerns with inability to reach the keys on keyboard due to motor restrictions.
### vi) Strength to press a key (CH14)
It refers to the lack of strength to press the keys on a regular keyboard.

## Severely hampered motor abilities:
Severe motor disability can cause complete immobility of the body. Below are two such cases:

### i) completely immobile upper limb with speech control (CH15)
This indicates the person can only use voice commands and cannot use other parts of the body.
### ii) completely immobile upper limb without speech control (CH16)
This indicates the person can neither use voice nor use other parts of the body.


# Documentation Challenges
Motor challenged students face many difficulties while documenting. These can be segmented into:
## i) reading a physical document(CH17)
It refers to the challenges faced in reading and accessing physical documents.
## ii) accessing 'help' online (CH18)
This challenge is regarding accessing online help for managing various documentation supports.
