# Solutions

These are assistive technologies that we identified to support motor impaired students to use information systems.

## S01. Switch interface unit
This device is useful when the user needs accessible (as per their level of disability) switches for switching on the computer. Examples can be Button switch, Plate switch, Infrared switch, Sound-activated switch, Treadle switch, Pillow switch, Sip-and-puff switch, Eyeglass switch, Arm slot control switch.{wilson1993assistive}

## S26. Scanning documents into accessible computers 
Scanning generates a PDF document that is a combination of "images" of the pages scanned. It is difficult for the users to copy, paste or edit these scanned documents. Therefore, they need to be converted into electronic text by optical character recognition (OCR) software for accessibility. {burgstahler2002working,fichten2009disabilities}
